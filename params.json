{"name":"Gopkgsearch","body":"Instant searching of the packages in GOROOT/src/pkg and GOPATH.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\nGopkgsearch requires that the Go source code is available on the machine and that the GOROOT environment variable has been set. See http://golang.org/doc/install/source#environment\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nGopkgsearch can be fetched using 'go get':\r\n\r\n  `go get github.com/PaulSamways/gopkgsearch`\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nStarting Gopkgsearch without any parameters will cause the Go source files to be indexed and a web server to be started on port 8000. If you want to have your GOPATH directories indexed as well then the -useGoPath option can be used.\r\n\r\n  `./gopkgsearch [-useGoPath=true]`\r\n\r\nOnce Gopkgsearch has been started, open a web browser to localhost:8000 and start searching.\r\n\r\n","tagline":"Go Package Searching","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
